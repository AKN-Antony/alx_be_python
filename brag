✅ 1. Summary of What I Worked On
This month, I began my journey into programming with Python as my primary language. I focused on:

Understanding Python syntax and basic operations

Writing simple scripts that use variables, arithmetic, and user input

Learning how to structure and organize code in files

Building foundational logic like conditionals and loops

🏆 2. My Achievements
Created and ran my first Python programs

Completed small projects like a rectangle area calculator and a finance savings estimator

Began understanding the importance of user input and basic program flow

Took the first step toward my long-term goal of becoming a backend software engineer

⚙️ 3. Learnings from Challenges
Struggled with syntax at first, like proper indentation and variable naming, but learned how crucial these are in Python

Faced confusion with logic structuring (e.g., how to use input effectively), which pushed me to break problems down into smaller steps

Realized the importance of naming conventions and consistent formatting

Discovered how powerful debugging and reflection are when something doesn’t work

🌟 4. Monthly Highlights
Wrote my first working programs from scratch 🙌

Started forming a consistent learning routine and using tools like ChatGPT to clarify concepts

Felt more confident each time a script ran successfully

Set clear direction: Backend Development with Python as the core language

💡 Looking Ahead:
Next month, I aim to explore:

Functions and modular coding

Basic data structures (lists, dictionaries)

Git & GitHub for tracking progress

Starting small backend-focused projects (e.g., CLI tools or simple APIs)
